Based on available developer resources and modern practices, the application technology stack was chosen to be Laravel, React, and NGINX connected to existing PostgreSQL, MySQL, and Redis data stores. Inertia.js was selected as middleware to facilitate Laravel server side rendering of the front end SPA to increase developer full stack productivity and reduce implementation time. The application was containerized for Docker and Kubernetes deployment, and a robust Jenkins pipeline was built out for advanced CI/CD. The application is currently leveraged by about 1000 property level administrators to significantly improve operational efficiency."

Rundeck provides functionality to act as a rudimentary but capable server manager and feature rich job scheduler. As the resource lead, I was responsible for maintaining the instance, onboarding fellow team members and integrating their existing jobs, implementing and peer reviewing custom Java plugins, and providing documentation and other resources for the platform and its continued evolution."

          "description": "As an engineer that began my career in systems administration, supporting a mixed ecosystem of Mac, PC, and Linux assets, I learned very early the many idiosyncrasies a piece of software can have as a consequence of being run in different environments. Since then, I have been a staunch supporter of containerized architecture. When I began at Penn, one of first initiatives I wanted to drive was setting a standard for containerization principles and demonstrate the benefits of making the effort. Focusing on the first project I was tasked with, the full stack administrative application mentioned above, I made sure that from the beginning of the SDLC, we built exclusively in containers. I built what most would probably consider to be a rather overkill DevOps setup for the scope of the application at that point in time. With multi-stage docker sequences, purposeful container networking, reliable scripting, and early kubernetes integration, we achieved single command deployment for everything from a local development environment to a full scale production release. \n\n\n\nProceeding with this throughout the rest of the application development, it became clear to the greater team as more developers were onboarded to the project, the inherit benefits of this architecture were vast. Not a single developer quarrel over feature functionality on one machine vs another and no overly complex readme's with headache inducing build instructions. Quickly, it became a department focus to migrate our other applications to the same architecture. For the next several months, I led internal trainings and knowledge transfer sessions to advise other team members on how to achieve similar outcomes in the projects they oversee. I also personally guided containerization efforts for our most critical financial processing application, which proved to be one of the more technically complex implementations I have encountered, requiring an intimate understanding of Docker at the OS level. The fruits of this initiative were quickly noticed, we saw a 40% drop in overall support tickets and a much higher reliability score as revealed in internal audits. Our developer onboarding process became significantly more efficient, and by consequence, productivity increased with PM's reporting much faster burn rates on our Jira boards."

          "description": "In 2021, when I first started, Penn was predominantly run with on-premise infrastructure, but looking to evolve into becoming a hybrid cloud organization. Having had first hand experience achieving this in prior roles, I was quick to embrace that focus. As the COVID-19 pandemic drove decision making in the gaming and hospitality space, demand was at an all time high for a more cloud centric approach to systems design. This technical evolution exposed new avenues through which we could radically improve our guest experience by leveraging cloud based, real-time, event driven systems architecture. I led expansion into crafting reliable, high throughput, Kinesis data pipelines from a wide variety of producer origins. We progressed from only having fresh data available for actionable decision making on a daily or weekly basis, to the ability to do so within seconds. Introducing totally new prospects for ways our property staff can best engage with our customers."
