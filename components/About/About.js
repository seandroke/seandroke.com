                  I am 23 years old, born and raised in the Greater Philadelphia Area. For the majority of my life, I have called
                  Medford, New Jersey home. I am the eldest of three boys, born of two math teachers, yet I was always partial to the
                  sciences.<br/><br/>I'm known to always be looking for a different way to solve something, and not stopping until I find an
                  answer to the problems I face. I have always been fascinated with computers, and I can't think of a career with more
                  new and exciting problems than that which I have found in Computer Science. I am endlessly eager to learn that which I don't
                  know and love to meet and collaborate with new faces along the way.<br/><br/>Outside of that, I am well known for falling 
                  down deep YouTube rabit holes to satisfy my ever growing curiosity, and I love to embrace my creativity with
                  personal projects just like this site! I enjoy spending quality time with friends and loved ones, and of course,
                  watching my fair share of the Eagles, regardless of how upset they might make me!
